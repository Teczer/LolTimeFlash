Melee champions drop red orbs that grant progress towards  Darkin, while  ranged champions drop blue orbs that grant progress for  Shadow Assassin. Orbs will remain on the ground until automatically collected by Kayn regardless of range once he leaves combat. The orbs will be collected even if Kayn  dies.\nThe experience bar above his portrait gauges his current progression, the color reflects the form with greater progress. Kayn can transform by interacting with his portrait, and can wait 4 minutes until the other form becomes available, reduced by 5 seconds for each collected orb of their type after that.\n\nMelee orbs grant 2 points per hit and 6 points per takedown.\nRanged orbs grant 3 points per hit and 7 points per takedown.\nThe amount of points received per orb is multiplied by 3 − 10.39 (based on minutes).\nThe bar gets filled up completely at 500 points.\nIf the two forms are within 8% of each other, the last champion range type hit will determine the winner. If both types are hit at the same time, the trasformation will default to  Darkin.\nEach side's bar has a bucket system, starting at 60 points.\nEach time an orb is taken the system checks if there's an amount of points in the bucket equal to or higher than the amount received from the orb.If there is, Kayn is given an additional orb of the same type he received, while also subtracting that amount of points from the bucket.\nThe bucket fills by 0.8 points per second if out of champion combat for 70 seconds.\nDamage dealt by  damage over time effects and specifically  First Strike and  Summon Aery will not grant orbs.",

This does not occur if Kayn is in the process of emerging from the target.\nIf those same conditions occur before the attachment, Kayn will reappear at the target's location after completing the dash.\nIn both of these cases, Umbral Trespass will occasionally not go on cooldown.(bug)\nKayn will automatically emerge when attached to a  clone that expires.\nIf Kayn dies while  attached and the recast is available, Umbral Trespass'  damage is dealt immediately. If the recast is not available, Umbral Trespass'  damage is not dealt at all.\nEntering  resurrection while  attached does not deal Umbral Trespass'  damage regardless of if the recast is available or not.\nKayn will detach immediately in both cases.\nDuring Umbral Trespass, Kayn will not take the self-inflicted damage from  Death's Dance's Ignore Pain if the damage was sourced from a  turret.\nAs  Rhaast, Umbral Trespass will grant the  heal automatically if the target dies during the channel.\nThe heal is not granted if the target dies before the channel starts.\nUmbral Trespass'  interactions with  crowd control:\nBeing  stunned or  silenced or falling  asleep while  attached will cause the ability to recast automatically (even during the 0.75-second delay before Kayn is able to recast after attaching).\nUmbral Trespass  cleanses Kayn from  drowsiness.\nKayn is immune to  fear during Umbral Trespass.\n Roots will not prevent Kayn from initiating the recast.\n Displacements cannot interrupt the initial dash and neither can they apply while Kayn is attached. If the airborne source applies a debuff, Kayn attaches to his target immediately, ending the dash prematurely in the process. The debuff is also removed instantly.\nUntil the recast or after the duration, the ability will have had no effect on the target for the purposes of  Electrocute or the 'in-combat' status.\n Spell shields will prevent Kayn from infesting the target, but will do nothing to mitigate the recast when used once he has already infested them.\nIf Kayn targets an enemy that is currently being protected by a spell shield, the ability will simply go on cooldown without making him infest his target.\nThis is also true for  Fiora's  Riposte.\nUmbral Trespass cannot be cast on targetable  zombie states such as  Sion during  Glory in Death.\nKayn will draw  turret aggro after the recast's dash, despite the damage occurring while he was untargetable.\nThe damage is not blocked if the target becomes  untargetable.\nKayn will copy his target's total size for Umbral Trespass'  duration, even if their size is smaller than his.\nThe screen will direct to the target's position upon attaching.\nAs  Rhaast, an  alternate icon is used for the initial activation of Umbral Trespass.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Kayn is  channeling and dashing out of the victim:\nThe dash out is not interrupted by  cast-inhibiting crowd control.\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\n Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath Cast-inhibiting effects",
