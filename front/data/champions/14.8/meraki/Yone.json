The amount starts at 500 and rapidly decays down to 0. It counts down from the start of the cast, not after the 0.5-second delay.\nWith 0.5 seconds remaining before the recast occurs automatically, a distinct sound will cue and the corners of the screen will briefly turn a faint dark. This is only visible and audible to Yone.\nYone's body unit cannot be interacted with by any means. It will despawn as soon as Yone's dash back ends.\nSoul Unbound's recast, even when cast automatically, counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as  Spellblade and triggering  Force Pulse's passive.\nYone is also  displacement immune during the cast time.\nSoul Unbound's recast does not interrupt Yone's last movement or attack order.\nYone will place himself onto the ground and interrupts  displacements affecting him upon recasting.\nSoul Unbound's recast is notable for being an ability that  removes  crowd control but cannot be activated while unable to cast abilities or mobility spells due to the same crowd control.\nSoul Unbound does not  cleanse the following  crowd control effects (ones not listed below are removed):\n Disarm\nOnly the  silence portion from  polymorph will be removed.\n Ground\n Nearsight\n Silence\n Slow\n Wither will not be removed.\nSome examples of effects that can delay Soul Unbound's automatic recast:\nAttack windup\nCast time\n Channels (excluding  Hexflash)\n Lockouts\n Dashes\n Immobilizes,  Silence,  Ground, and  Stasis\n Devour\n Fate's Call\nYone instantly appears at his body's location the moment this effect ends.\n Realm Warp\nSoul Unbound's recast is disabled (cannot be manually nor automatically cast) while Yone is in the  Realm of Death or  The Hextech Ultimatum. The recast will be deferred until those effects end.\n The Hextech Ultimatum will specifically end if Yone recasts Soul Unbound.\nIf Yone uses  Mortal Steel at two Gathering Storm stacks to delay Soul Unbound's automatic recast, he will be able to basic attack once in a short time period before the automatic recast triggers.\nIf Yone  dies or enters  resurrection with Spirit Form, he will immediately initiate the recast and dash back to his body while dead or resurrecting.\nIf he dies during the recast, the dash back is not interrupted.\nHis death animation will play upon arriving to his body.\nThe marks do not store damage from items, runes and summoner spells.\nThe mark also automatically detonates without Yone having to recast when the marked champion dies or enters  resurrection.\nThe detonation damage cannot be dodged by becoming  untargetable.\nThe marks will not store damage dealt to  shields.\nIf the mark's damage is higher than the target's current health, the mark indicator will have a slightly different appearance.\nThis does not take into account effects that would amplify the damage of the mark, such as  Coup de Grace.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Yone is in cast time and dashing back to his body:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite  Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash  Mark  Dash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A",
