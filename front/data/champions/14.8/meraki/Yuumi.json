For example,  turret shots will appear as if they were hitting the Anchor, but in reality they're actually hitting Yuumi.\nHowever, for the purposes of You and Me!, such as casting it or being unattached for other reasons, Yuumi will be in the position where she visually is. For example, when she is in the blue team, dashing to a north-east ally is considerably slower than dashing to a south-west ally.\nHer  monster aggression transfers to the Anchor.\nEnemies gain an assist on Yuumi if they damaged the Anchor.\nYuumi will always be  visible if her Anchor can be seen, and she will always not be visible if her Anchor cannot be seen. These rules apply regardless of  reveal effects and  stealth.\nYuumi will not  vanish if her Anchor does.\nIf Yuumi is on the blue team, she will remain attached on the southwest side; if Yuumi is on the red team, she will remain on the northeast. While channeling  Final Chapter, she will be behind her Anchor.\nYuumi doesn't detach instantly when her Anchor dies. There's a small grace period in which she can recast You and Me! to attach to another champion without the  channel.\nThe player's screen will briefly flash red if Yuumi is affected by a  immobilizing or  grounding effect, or if she forcibly detaches from her Anchor.\nYuumi can channel You and Me! on allies that are not  visible to her (e.g. if she is  nearsighted standing inside  Graves'  Smoke Screen) if she casts it while having her cursor at their position (this means that Yuumi have to guess their allies' position).(bug)\nThe Anchor's health bar will have a different frame to indicate the attached status:\n\nThe following table refers for interactions while Yuumi is  channeling:\n\n\nType\n\nChannel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll the other item-actives are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\n Flash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath Grounding effects Immobilizing effects Cast-inhibiting effects\n\nThe following table refers for interactions while Yuumi is  attached:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nAllowed\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nAll the other item-actives are usable\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Hextech Rocketbelt  Stridebreaker\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath",
