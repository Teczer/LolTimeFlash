The health threshold increases with Stretching Strikes' damage.\nIf the second attack's target would die from the damage, it won't be dealt until they are slammed to the first target.\nNon-champion units that are affected by Stretching Strikes' displacement are prevented from taking any damage until they are slammed together. Note that this often confuses players who are trying to secure  monsters via  Smite while Zac is slamming the wanted target, resulting in Smite dealing no damage to it. It is currently unknown whatever the side effects of this feature are intentional or not.\n Spell shields will block a single instance of damage only.\nIf the tethered target is  untargetable during the second Stretching Strike via basic attack, they are completely unaffected by the ability.\n Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the  stun.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.\nIf the target becomes  untargetable,  dies, or is too far away during the empowered attack's cast time, it is cancelled but not consumed.\nThe following refers for interactions during the activation's cast time:\n\n\nType\n\nCast time\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll the other item-actives are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath, unless protected by  Resurrection",
