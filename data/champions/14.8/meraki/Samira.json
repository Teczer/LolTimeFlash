It will not apply if they are no longer disabled when hit.\nThe empowered attack cannot be used against a target with a  spell shield.\nThe application of the knock up can occur on any of the missiles of the empowered attack if it had not already occurred on the first missile.\nA missile that is parried by  Riposte or is  dodged,  blocked, or missed while Samira is  blinded cannot apply the knock up.\nWhile  grounded or  rooted, Samira cannot  dash into range to use the empowered attack. She can only use it if her target is within her  attack range while under this condition.\nThe on-target cooldown will apply even if the empowered attack is parried.\nThe empowered attack rolls  critical strike for each shot of the flurry.\nThe bonus magic damage dealt with the blade is  default damage. The empowered attack is first 1 instance of  basic damage and then 5 instances of  default damage.\nThe attacks do not deal the bonus damage against structures.\nThe empowered attack is unaffected by  attack speed modifiers.\n Guinsoo's Rageblade's Phantom Hit and  Runaan's Hurricane's bolts will not apply the bonus magic damage, since it is a hit effect of specifically the melee attack casts.\nAttacks with the gun and blade do not count as different attacks for stacking Style.\nBasic attacks using the blade are still classified as  ranged.\nThe melee attack's range condition is unaffected by  attack range modifiers (e.g.  Rapid Firecannon).\nBlade range is calculated edge-to-edge just like basic attack ranges are, hence both Samira gaining bonus size or her target increases the total distance at which Samira can attack them with the blade.\nSince the  knock up requires an exterior source to  immobilize the enemy,  Aftershock will be swapped with  Grasp of the Undying for Samira at the start of the game.\nSince  Inferno Trigger's cooldown is static,  Ultimate Hunter will be swapped with  Treasure Hunter for Samira at the start of the game.\nAbilities blocked by  spell shields will still grant Samira Style stacks.\nSamira still gains Style stacks from damaging attacks and abilities landed against  clones.",
