Targets further away from the center of the blast are hit after a slightly longer delay. These attacks do not apply on-attack effects.\nChanging weapons while Moonlight Vigil is in flight does not change the effect it has when it hits.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.\nMoonlight Vigil's effect radius is centered around the location of the missile as it collides.\nWith  Calibrum, the extra damage from consuming the mark is a bonus damage on top of Calibrum's  normal mark consumption damage.\nWith  Infernum, 14 fire bolts splash from each target hit (18 for  critical strikes). This does not occur if the initial damage of Moonlight Vigil kills the target.\nWith  Infernum,the splash attacks damage is also modified by Infernum attack secondary target damage amplifier, which means it only deals 70.125% (=82.5%*85%) of attack damage to secondary targets before level 9.\nWith  Crescendum, 1 spectral chakram is gained for every target hit by the blast, meaning it is possible to gain up to 10 spectral chakrams with one use of Moonlight Vigil if it hits 5 enemy champions.\nWith  Severum, the extra flat heal is given only once, not per target. However, all damage done by Moonlight Vigil with it also heals him from Severum's  own passive effect.\nThe locked-on attacks' can be  dodged and  blocked, but won't be prevented if Aphelios is  blinded.\nPreventing the attack also prevents the additional effect (e.g. marking them with  Gravitum or granting  spectral chakrams).\nMoonlight Vigil has different visual effects changed accordingly to each weapon.
