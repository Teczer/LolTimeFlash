        "notes": "Details\nSion's death timer starts when he dies and not when Glory in Death ends.\nIf Sion lives longer than what his death timer lasts for, he will not revive until Glory in Death has ended. When it ends, he instantly revives. This may result in some odd interactions and bugs at times.\nThe effect that heals Sion back to full health at the start of Glory in Death cannot be modified by  healing reductions and does not count towards the 'Damage Healed' statistic at the end of game lobby.\nThe health loss is unaffected by  Invulnerability.\nGlory in Death has a capped 60 seconds duration. If the player manages to survive for so long, Sion dies instantly, regardless of his current health.\nThe healing modifier during Glory in Death reduces all incoming healing, it does not matter if they are sourced from Sion himself or an ally. This does not affect life steal.\nThis healing modifier stacks additively with  Spirit Visage and does not stack with heal and shield power.\nThis means that purchasing Spirit Visage enables Sion to have regeneration and use healing effects at 25% effectiveness, and the life steal gained will be increased to 125% as expected.\nThe fixed attack speed is achieved by lowering and increasing the maximum and minimum attack speed to  1.75, respectively.\nThis also means that it's unaffected by other attack speed modifiers for the duration, such as bonus attack speed or  cripples.\nHowever,  Hail of Blades, which allows for the normal attack speed cap ( 2.5) to be surpassed, will also break this limit. This means that while it is active, Sion may exceed his  1.75 cap, but cannot fall below it.\nThis does not apply to  Lethal Tempo.\nWhen  Hail of Blades ends, the attack speed cap will revert to  2.5 and not to  1.75, however Sion still can't fall below  1.75.\nSome item passives do not persist through death and will be lost for the initial few seconds of Glory in Death.\n Phase Rush cooldown is reset upon entering Glory in Death.\nThe bonus on-hit damage granted by Glory in Death is unaffected by life steal, but is applied against structrures that are not turrets.\nHowever, it can be applied against structures that are not turrets.(bug)\nThe reduction of damage against structures includes Sion's attacks as well as on-hit effects that can be applied to structures, such as  Demolish,  Titanic Hydra and the magic damage based on AP conversion based on  adaptive force.\nIt even includes  true damage from sources such as  Elixir of Sorcery.(bug)\nSion, during Glory in Death, will not lose health while being carried by  Fate's Call.\nGlory in Death does not trigger on clones of Sion, such as with  Test of Spirit.\nGlory in Death's  untargetability from the  stasis does not  destroy in-flight  projectiles.\nProjectiles created while Sion is in the zombie form will still travel to him even after he dies.\nUpon death, the current cooldowns of Sion's summoner spells are increased to 4 seconds. Afterwards, he is still unable to use them until he respawns.\nHowever, it is possible for another lock-out effect to unlock them when their duration ends (excluding  crowd control with the exception of  stasis).\nAfter Glory in Death ends, the corpse of Sion will retain unit collision despite being dead on the ground.\nBuffs from jungle monsters that Sion acquired during Glory in Death will not be lost when the duration ends. ( Crest of Cinders,  Crest of Insight)\nInteractions & Other\n\nBy surviving for the full duration of 60 seconds, Sion will have suffered 41.8k − 443.7k (based on level) in health costs.\nSion can also heal from  spell vamp, althought the stat is currently unobtainable and it would be also unusable during Glory in Death, since there would be no available abilities that would apply it.\nEven though its visuals are present,  Dark Harvest can never be gained from Sion under the effect of Glory in Death.\nAt the start of Glory in Death, Sion's  mana drops to 0, but his  mana regeneration will remain in effect.\nZombie info\nZombie states trigger upon taking  lethal damage.\n Raw damage effects will not prevent zombie states from triggering.\nAll  resurrection effects will take precedence over effects that reanimate as a zombie.\nA champion that enters a zombie state will start their death timer upon triggering the effect.\nMost buffs and debuffs will be lost upon transitioning into a zombie state.\nThose that persist through death, such as  Brand's  Blaze, will remain.\nUndisplayed marker buffs, such as those imposed by  Veigar's  Event Horizon and  Viktor's  Gravity Field to prevent being affected multiple times by the same effect, will be lost.(bug)\nThis does not apply when transitioning from one zombie state to another zombie state.(bug)\nUnits within a zombie state cannot:\nUse  Recall or  Corrupting Potion /  Refillable Potion.\nActivate  resurrection effects.\nTake  Dark Passage, Catapult, or gates.\nPick up the  Eye of the Herald.\nBe targeted by the following:\n Bailout\n Chronoshift\n Umbral Trespass.\nBe affected by the following:\n Curse of the Black Mist\n Fear Beyond Death's chain missile\n Test of Spirit's initial missile\n Lamb's Respite\n Realm of Death\nFountain health restore",

White cone has a radius of 720, while yellow cone has a radius of 1550.  \nSion himself remains  locked out of all actions for 0.25 seconds when releasing Decimating Smash.\n Soul Furnace can be cast during this time, but  Roar of the Slayer and  Unstoppable Onslaught cannot and neither will they be buffered.\n Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the  stun.\nSince the  stun duration is longer than the  airborne duration, and both start at the same time,  Tenacity is still fully effective against Decimating Smash up to a cap.\nThis virtual cap is 60%-55.5%  Tenacity based on channel time beyond 1 second. Every value below this cap will lower the CC duration with no diminished returns.\nA flash of the axe and change in brightness of the indicator on the ground indicates when the 1 second time frame is reached.\nThe damage of Decimating Smash is calculated when it is released. Gaining AD or upgrading the ability during its channel will update the damage of the coming hit.\nEven though the cooldown starts when the ability is released, it will not be changed by gaining or losing AH, or upgrading the ability, during the cast time.\nThe indicator is visible to the enemy only if they  see Sion himself.\nIf the channel is released before 1 second, enemies may see a particle at the far end of the hitbox, if it itself isn't outside of their  vision.\nIf the channel is released after 1 second, the only remaining indication is the visual effects and audio that plays on any units the spell strikes (these play on-target), provided the enemy does have  vision on those.\nForced movement without a  stun component (or the stun being  cleansed previously) will not stop Sion from starting or continuing to channel. Its direction will not change with Sion's travel, however the location will update with him.\nThe location of the indicator updates at the beginning of the ability, at 1 second and at release.\nThe indicator of the ability is slightly shorter at its front than the hitbox of the ability is for  Original Sion,  Mecha Zero Sion and related skins and chromas, while on  Worldbreaker Sion, the indicator is slightly thinner at the front than the hitbox is, instead.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Sion is  channeling:\n\n\nType\n\nCharge channel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Soul Furnace and its  recast are usable.

        "notes": "When Sion casts Unstoppable Onslaught a global warning can be heard.\nUnstoppable Onslaught does not apply the knock up nor stun to enemies from slamming on collision with terrain.\nUnstoppable Onslaught does not  knock up non-champions hit by the charge.(bug)\nUnstoppable Onslaught can be activated twice or held down and released on both normal cast and quick cast. There is no other difference between normal cast and quick cast for this ability, either.\nThe initial cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as  Spellblade.\nThe recast does not.\nAn enemy can only be affected by Unstoppable Onslaught once every 1 second.\nAfter reaching maximum damage and stun duration (at 3 seconds) Sion will transition from using his haste animation to his unique charging one.\nReaching the threshold on  Mecha Zero Sion changes his particle effects instead, most notably the 'Boosters' behind the vehicle.\nThe turning angle is not based on time and can easily be seen in practice when a Sion charges in-place due to bugs.\nSion's movement speed gains during the charge are unaffected by movement speed caps. Effects that would increase or decrease his movement speed do not affect him as well.\n Nami's  Surging Tides is the only known effect that can affect Sion's movement speed during the charge and that can place him above the normal MS value. However, without further multipliers, surpassing the 950 movement speed cap will require  Nami to have over 2150 ability power.\nSion does not always crash with terrain immediately upon touching it, enabling the player to turn beyond his maximum turning angle.\nCasting the ability at point blank of a terrain will most often automatically change the charge's direction.\nThis is not usually possible with player-generated terrain.\nUnstoppable Onslaught cannot charge through but can leap over player-generated terrain.\nSion loses the  crowd control immunity after finishing the  leap.\nSion is not immune to an allied  Bard's  Tempered Fate if it hits Sion during the 0.05-second delay before he starts the channel, he will not resist the effect and will initiate the slam immediately while in  stasis.(bug)\nUnstoppable Onslaught cannot strike the same non-champion twice in less than 1 second.\nEven though the cooldown of Unstoppable Onslaught starts at the end of the effect, gaining or losing ability haste, or upgrading the ability during the effect, will not change the resuming cooldown.\n Removing the  airborne before 0.5 seconds will not prevent the  stun from being applied.\n Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the  stun.\nSion can occasionally cast Unstoppable Onslaught while  rooted. In this case, he will stand in place until the root's debuff duration ends. During this time, the damage, stun duration and movement speed granted by the ability will still ramp up, and enemies that come into contact with him will be affected by the collision normally.(bug)\nA similar case allows him to cast it during crowd control that would disable it. However, the channel would be interrupted almost immediately, and he will initiate the leap as well.\n Fate's Call deferment of Unstoppable Onslaught will still allow Sion to leap forward at the end of the channel.\nMoving the cursor onto HUD elements (e.g mini map / champion portraits) does not jeopardize the cast and steering of Unstoppable Onslaught. The targeting will act as if the ground was targeted below the display element.\n PENDING FOR TEST: The distance between Sion's center and the center of the ground slam scales slightly with movement speed. This is suspected because running into a wall within half a second of charge time after starting at multiple thousands of movement speed shows a considerable difference, however this could also be due to a bug.\n PENDING FOR TEST: The leap appears to always have the same speed regardless of Sion's, at roughly 750.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Sion is  channeling:\n\n\nType\n\nChannel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Soul Furnace and its  recast are usable.  Decimating Smash and  Roar of the Slayer are disabled. This ability recasts to end channel.\n\n\nMovement\n\nAllowed, but cannot input movement commands.\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite  Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash  Mark  Dash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath\n\nIf Unstoppable Onslaught's channel is interrupted despite the immunity to crowd control or  Decimating Smash is cast within 0.25 seconds after starting the charge, it will also initiate the leap. If the channel ends due to collision or death, there is no  leap and the effect occurs immediately.",
