        "notes": "Spirits are classified as  clones:\nSpirits can only be fully targeted by Illaoi's team and neutral monsters. The Spirit's allies cannot manually select it as a valid target for spells and abilities, but they can still do so with automatically targetted effects. (bug)\nSpirits take 50% damage from turrets. (bug)\nSpirits cannot be  healed nor  shielded ( Summon Aery excluded (bug)).\nThe Spirit levels up when the Vessel does, gaining the target's stats per level. If the target has a resource that also increases per level (i.e  mana), the Spirit's lifetime will increase instead. (bug)\nThe Spirit's destination is decided based on Illaoi's position and facing direction when the target is hit.\nThe Spirit is  untargetable while it is being pulled, and spawns with the tethered champion's default model and size.\nThe Spirit's lifetime is sometimes 0.25 seconds longer, while its untargetability is sometimes shorter, causing Tentacles to hit an inconsistent amount of times.\nRedirected damage is calculated by taking the pre-mitigation damage against the Spirit, applying Test of Spirit's damage modifier, and then capping it to the Spirit's current health. This damage will then be affected by damage modifiers (resistances and other effects) of the Vessel.\nThis order of operations allows Test of Spirit to deal more or less percentage of the Vessel's health than would be expected:\nBecause the Spirit's modifiers can be different from the Vessel's, and the damage being pre-mitigated, allowing the Spirit to have higher or lower effective health, respectively increasing or decreasing the maximum achievable damage from killing it.\nBecause the cap is supposed to block excess damage over the Spirit's current health, which does not reliably do so or does too well, depending on whether the Spirit's damage modifier is higher than Test of Spirit's or not, respectively. This causes an increasing difference of damage when the pre-mitigated damage is between Spirit current health ÷ Spiritmod and Spirit current health ÷ Emod. (bug)\nTo fix this case, pre-mitigated damage would need to be capped at the amount that kills the Spirit, and only then have Test of Spirit's damage modifier apply.\nIllaoi needs 937.5 / 875 / 812.5 / 750 / 687.5 total AD to reach 100% redirected damage. As per above, the damage is still dependent on the Spirit's and Vessel's damage modifiers and may not always be able to deal 100% of the target's current health as total redirected damage.\n Spell shields may only prevent the initial spirit grab and the slow upon becoming a Vessel. Spell shields will not prevent becoming a Vessel or Tentacles from attacking.\nThe tendril can be blocked by abilities such as  Yasuo's  Wind Wall, but the returning tether slow cannot, even if it can otherwise be  destroyed by effects that can do so (i.e  untargetability).\nThe tether slow will not be fired if the target is already  untargetable when the Spirit dies.\nThe spirit pull is not considered a  crowd control effect and will not be blocked by  crowd control immunity, with the exception of  Morgana's  Black Shield.(bug)\nThe projectile tentacle model is linked to Illaoi's model animation and size. However gameplay wise it is not, thus the actual hitbox being different than the position, width and length of the visible model. (bug)\nThe model will stop mid-air / vanish if Illaoi goes into  stasis,  sleep or  airborne, however the actual hitbox will continue its trajectory unseen.\n PENDING FOR TEST: The projectile is however seen by enemies if Illaoi is not  visible.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.\nAnd will fire towards the same pointed location.\nGrabbing the Spirit of a champion before it goes into  resurrection via  Chronoshift or  Guardian Angel will spawn the Spirit with 0 health, making it  invulnerable. (bug)\nThe same does not happen with other resurrection effects (i.e  Karthus'  Death Defied) since they leave the champion with more than 0 health.\nGrabbing the Spirit of  Viego will make the Spirit's lifetime (the white bar below the lifebar) disappear. (bug)\n PENDING FOR TEST: Grabbing the Spirit of an  Oathsworn will make the Spirit invisible. (bug)\nIllaoi is the only one able to see who's been Vesseled, by adding a layer of watery effects on their model. The Vessel will also be let known it's debuffed, by having a layer of watery effects on its screen instead.\nIf the target becomes a Vessel while  vanished, the layer on their model will fail to be added. (bug)\nThe Vessel status effect is a debuff that doesn't persist through death.\nIf the target is made a Vessel while  resurrecting, they will not revive as a Vessel.\nRunes consider the Spirit as a champion for their effects and stat-tracking. (bug)\nTentacles damage with  First Strike only reflects double bonus damage, not taking into account actual damage done to the Spirit (e.g if  First Strike would deal 3 bonus damage, what would get reflected is 6 damage). (bug)\nTransferred damage will apply on-damage effects, such as  Black Cleaver,  Morellonomicon,  Executioner's Calling,  Riftmaker,  Aspect of the Dragon burn damage, and  The Darkin Scythe.\nRedirected damage always counts as single target for the purpose of  Omnivamp.\nTransferred damage will not doubly apply on-hit or on-spell effects versus the target (e.g.  Liandry's Torment,  Phase Rush stacks). These effects are only applied versus the Spirit.\nAttacking the Vessel and its Spirit simultaneously will only apply one stack of  Black Cleaver to the Vessel. (bug)\nWhen the tether is broken (whether the Spirit's lifetime ran out or the target moved out of range), the Spirit will  vanish and move to Illaoi's location.\nAn  uncancellable windup attack may still kill the Spirit after it vanished to grant the gold, but without making the target a Vessel.\nThe Spirit is immune to  stasis (i.e.  Bard's  Tempered Fate).\n Fiora's  Riposte can be used to prevent becoming a Vessel if used before the Spirit is killed or while leaving the tether's range.\n Sion's Spirit cannot be spawned during  Glory in Death. Spirits created before Sion's  zombie state will remain active.\nIf the target that had its Spirit pulled from them is taken into the  Realm of Death, the tether will break, but they will not be made into a Vessel.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Illaoi is firing the projectile and while the target's Spirit is being pulled:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Tentacle Smash and  Leap of Faith are buffered.  Harsh Lesson is usable, but is buffered while pulling the Spirit.

(towards Illaoi's facing direction)\n2+ champions: one  Tentacle at 60 degrees.\n3+ champions: one  Tentacle at 300 degrees.\n4+ champions: one  Tentacle at 120 degrees.\n5+ champions: one  Tentacle at 240 degrees.\n6+ champions: one  Tentacle at 180 degrees.\nTentacles may spawn on base barriers. If Illaoi is in the center of a base barrier, all Tentacles will spawn in the same position and stack over each other, making it appear as if there was only one Tentacle.\nIllaoi's facing direction is decided by the position of the cursor on cast, but can also be changed mid-cast through other effects, such as  Flash.\nIf there are no walls nearby, spawning the last  Tentacle will form a perfect hexagon.\n Spell shields will block the ability's damage but will not prevent Tentacles from spawning.\nIf Illaoi  dies within 0.25 seconds of dropping down, she will spawn buffed Tentacles, but she won't manage in time to buff the already spawned ones. (bug)\nIf Illaoi is near a Tentacle that is about to spawn, it will spawn buffed by Leap of Faith even if Illaoi is no longer nearby.\nUsing  Harsh Lesson after Illaoi drops down will command Tentacles to instantly attack, regardless if they were already attacking. Their old attack will keep on going and will hit while the second attack is on its animation attack. (bug)\nThis makes it possible for the same tentacle to reduce its own damage by having the second attack hit too fast, which is not otherwise possible.\nUsing  Harsh Lesson an instant before Leap of Faith's buff finishes will delay the Tentacle's attack.
