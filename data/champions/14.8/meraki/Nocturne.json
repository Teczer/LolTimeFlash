This also causes bonus critial damage such as  Infinity Edge's passive to be 10% stronger on the attack. Now, the formula reduces the expected critical damage slightly by -2.5% AD, which is 10% of the reduction in base critical damage from Pre-Season 11.\nThe empowered attack will not trigger against structures nor wards.\nBasic attacks against them will still grant the cooldown reduction.\nParry effects will only block the damage dealt to the primary target.",
